These are some of the projects I did during the last course, which I finished in December.

ROLEPLAY
The first project is a website where you can create a roleplay character. You can add new characters, modify existing ones and delete them. I've worked in a team to build this website in 1 week.

SEARCH ENGINE PHOTOGRAPHER
The other project you can find here is the final project of the course. I build a search engine for clients who are looking 
for a photographer. You can actually filter the photographer by the filters on the left side of the initial page. You can
also create an account and buy a product of a photographer. The only thing which wasn't implemented is the payment service, 
but once you click on "buy product" the products do appear in your profile. The photographer can also create a profile, in which 
he/she can manage the products they have on the website. They can also get an overview of all the products they sold. Then, lastly, 
there is a special page for the administrator. The admin has access to all parts of the website and has the possibilty to create and
delete accounts/products etc.
