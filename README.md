These are some of the projects I did during the last course, which I finished in December.

    1. Roleplay characters

For this project, I worked in a team to build a website where users can create, modify, and delete roleplay characters. 
It allows users to add new characters with details like name, description, and traits, or update existing ones. We 
worked together to get the site ready in just one week, focusing on making it user-friendly and functional. It was a fun, 
fast-paced project that helped me improve my teamwork and coding skills while creating a space for users to manage their 
roleplay characters.

    2. Search engine for photographers

For this project, I built a search engine for photographers using PHP. On the homepage, there's a list of photographers 
that users can filter based on different criteria, making it easier to find the perfect match. There's a client area where 
users can log in to buy products from photographers. After making a purchase, they can view their bought items in their 
profile. Photographers also have their own area where they can track products they've sold and manage their listings, like 
adding images. Additionally, there's an admin login that gives access to manage clients, products, and photographers. It 
was a great project to work on, combining PHP for backend functionality with features that help both clients and 
photographers manage their profiles and transactions.
